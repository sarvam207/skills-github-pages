If you’ve ever built something cool with Django, you know the real headache starts right after you finish coding — **deployment**.  

When I first launched my project, I was happy to see it live on Render. Then the free tier ran out.  
So I moved to Railway. A few weeks later… that one hit its limit too. 😅  

That’s when I went down a rabbit hole to find **a truly free and reliable place** to host small Django apps — something I could keep running without worrying about “credit card required” or “usage exceeded” messages.

Here’s what I found.

## 💡 The Short Answer

After a lot of testing, reading docs, and a few deployment failures at 2 a.m.,  
**Koyeb** turned out to be the best “forever free” platform for my kind of projects.

## 🥇 Why I Picked Koyeb

Koyeb feels like what Heroku *used to be*. You connect your GitHub repo, pick Python, and it just… works.  
No Docker setup. No random billing warnings. Just clean and simple.

You get:
- 512 MB RAM  
- 2 GB SSD  
- 1 vCPU  
- Automatic deployment from GitHub  

That’s not much, but for a small Django project or portfolio app — it’s perfect.  
I paired it with a free PostgreSQL database from [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech), and the combo has been rock solid so far.

## ⚙️ My Setup Looks Like This

| Purpose | Service | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Django app | **Koyeb** | Free and easy to deploy |
| Database | **Neon.tech** | Simple PostgreSQL hosting |
| Static/media files | **Cloudinary** | Great free image hosting |
| Domain | **Freenom / Custom** | Optional, if you want a custom domain |

It took maybe 15 minutes to set up everything — and zero money.

## 🧠 What Didn’t Work

I tried Fly.io too — it’s a solid platform, but setting up Docker and managing memory for Django felt overkill for a small side project.  
Also, the “free allowance” wording made me nervous. You never know when the meter starts ticking.

AlwaysData was nice but has too little storage for anything beyond a test project.

---

## ✨ The Takeaway

If you’re a student, indie dev, or just experimenting,  
**Koyeb + Neon.tech + Cloudinary** is probably the best free stack you can get in 2025.

It’s simple, fast, and doesn’t die quietly when the free tier ends.  
I’ve had my Django app running for weeks without touching a thing — and it’s still alive, which is more than I can say for most “free” hosts.

Let’s keep our apps online (and our wallets closed) for as long as possible. 💸
