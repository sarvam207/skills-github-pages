Deploying a Django app can be a challenge — especially once you’ve hit the limits of Render and Railway’s free tiers.  
But don’t worry — there are **still solid options** for hosting your Django project *forever free*.

---

## 🧭 The Problem

Most free hosting providers either:
- Limit monthly hours or usage,  
- Require credit card verification, or  
- Drop the free tier after a while (like Heroku did 😅).

So, what’s left in 2025?

## 🚀 The Best “Forever Free” Options

### 🥇 **Koyeb**
- Simple, modern PaaS for deploying small web apps.
- Free tier includes 512 MB RAM and 2 GB SSD storage.
- GitHub integration for easy deployment.
- Great for small Django or Flask apps.

**Pro tip:** Pair it with a free PostgreSQL DB from [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) or [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

---

### 🥈 **Fly.io**
- Free “allowances” for small VM deployments.
- Ideal if you’re comfortable with Docker.
- Has global edge locations for faster access.

Watch your resource usage — going over the free limit may cost you.

---

### 🥉 **AlwaysData**
- Easiest setup for beginners.
- Built-in Django support — no Docker needed!
- Free plan with 100 MB storage, great for testing or portfolios.
